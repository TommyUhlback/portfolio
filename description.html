        <h3>AUDIO</h3>
        <p>
        <br>
            Our studies began on October 2024, with an introduction to the science and practice of sound recording.
            We learned to use Adobe Audition and a bit about audio-mixing. We also practiced 
            the use of handheld recorders and recoded speech in an audio studio using 
            Pro Tools: the industry standard Digital Audio Workstation (DAW).
            <br>
        <br>I already knew some things about recording audio due to my musical hobby.
            I'd had an audio interface and few microphones with a good amount of practice-hours
            behind by the time, but nothing more dramatic than bedroom-demos and guitar-playing-videos.
            This section of my studies 
            inspired me to buy my own entry level handheld recorder and sparked in me a new interest in
            sounscape recording.

        <h3>VIDEO</h3>
          <p>
          <br>The video course was the main focus of our studies for the end of 2024. We learned to use video 
          equipment using Sony PXW-z150 and z-190 video cameras. We learned technical aspects of the camera itself, and about  
          equipment such as tripods and microphones and lights and we learned a bit about working in a multi-camera production 
          at a green-screen studio. We were also introduced to storyboarding which is a visual representation of 
          the video, on paper, sort of like a script but with images.
          <br>During this course we also practiced video-editing. For example we learned efficient ways to edit
          multi-camera, green-screen footage, and how to synchronize sound and image.
          <br>
          <br>The main part of this course was the two videos I have embedded on the main page of my portfolio 
          in the <a href="index.html#section-3">'videos'</a> section. The first one is a 2 minute documentary 
          about Vuosaari. I chose Vuosaari as the topic of the video because of it's interesting history and 
          and nature locations. I wrote a speech about the topic and planned the trail I was going to follow 
          while shooting footage for the film. I ended up walking approximately 10 kilometers for 8 hours on the first day, 
          and 4 hours on the second day. I shot about 40 minutes of material mostly because I tended to take my 
          time with each indivudual shot. I shot the footage with a Sony PXW-Z150 video camera that I borrowed form school, 
          using mostly the 
          full auto setting, but also trying some different settings. The footage was shot in Full HD, 50FPS.
          <br>
          <br>Next was time for the post-production. I stareted by making a rough cut of the video by putting the 
          material roughly together. Then I moved to recording the speech. I recorded the speech at home, using my own 
          Rode NT1-A condencer microphone and Steinberg UR22 mkII audio-interface, with Cubase Artist 14 as the DAW.
          Since it was a windy day and I was not prepared with a proper microphone nor a windshield, I decided to
          return to location a week after, and record the ambience tracks for the video. I recorded the sound of 
          waves hitting the shore, at Aurikolahti beach and on the way I recorded the 'Vuosaari, Treminal' -sound 
          inside a metro-train. The sound of the passing metro-train itself I recorded at Kontula Metro station.
          For recording, I used Zoom H1n handheld recorder with a windshield.
          <br>
          <br>I played and recorded the music on the video myself as well. On the record I play nylon stringed guitar and 
          bongos which are recorded with the NT1-A microphone. On the record I also play bass-guitar and a Roland keyboard 
          which were plugged directly in to the audio-interface. On the bass track I'm using an amp-plugin and the keyboard sound is 
          from the instrument itself. The composing technique is mostly improvised and unplanned. The song contains not 
          much more than one chord (Em9).
          <br>I did light audio-mixing on the music in Cubase and then exported the music and the speech on separate files and 
          imported all files, including the ambience recordings, to Audition for further processing. In Audition I balanced the 
          volumes, equalized the frquencies and added some compression as well as pannings and fade in-/outs. I also did some normalizing.
          <br>
          <br>Now that I had the speech and other audio mixed it was easy to edit the video in Premiere Pro. I did the color grading with help 
          of the lumetri scopes by adjusting the exposure and blacks to their respective values and fixed slightly the white balance.
          With After Effects I did a suble text animation to the beginning of the film by using mask. And finally I added 
          English subtitles to the video.

        <h3>2D-ANIMATION</h3>
        <p>
        <br>During our video course we were also taught how to animate 2-dimensional elements in 
        After Effects using keyframes. Below is the very first keyframe animation that I did, 
        with public domain music and sound effects. 
        Other examples can be found from the main page <a href=index.html#section-4>Graphic Design</a> section.

        <h3>3D-MODELING</h3>
        <p>
        <br>At the end of the year we didn't have school for about two weeks, so I used this time to learn
        3D-modeling using Blender. Using Blender was actually easier than I had thought. First I watched 
        several different beginner-friendly tutorials from youtube, and followed through in order to learn 
        how to navigate the UI, and to learn the functions of different modifyers and basic keyboard shortcuts 
        like extrude and bevel, how to do texturing and how to set up lighting, how to do simple frame 
        animations etc. Then based on what I had learned, I did some of my own models.
        <br>The images of the Berry Soda cans on the main page is made by using Blender.

        <h3>WEB DESIGN/CODING</h3>
        <p>
        <br>I started to learn HTML and CSS coding a month or two before I coded this web-portfolio. 
        For learning I used a website that offers free coding tutorials. I learned the very basics of 
        coding, such as the basic structure of html document and what elements does the head and body contain, 
        how to add paragraphs, images, text-boxes and buttons, how to add fieldsets, divisions etc. 
        and how to style a page using CSS by coding different kinds of visual images by stacking division 
        elements inside of division elements in HTML-document, linking it to CSS document using class and ID
         attributes, and by creating different kinds of web-page layouts. 
         <br>To code my page I used AI-chatbots to figure out how to code a specific element, when I couldn't 
         figure out how to do so myself. For example I might have asked AI-chatbot "how to code a navbar with 
         dropdown content" or "how to animate a smooth zoom when an image is clicked on the image grid" etc. 
         <br>At school I learned about <i>search-engine-optimization</i>, how to use web page creation platforms to create 
         web-pages and alot of useful information such as what is a <i>meta-description</i> and for what 
         <i>alt-descriptions</i> in images are used for.
