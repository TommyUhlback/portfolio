       <h3>PRE-STUDIES</h3>

<p>2013-2016 I studied at Vantaan Ammattiopisto Varia to become an electrical technician. 
  During 2017-2019 i pondered about future and fueld my anxieties. 
  Also did the necessary military service and worked at different kinds of places as well as 
  practiced playing guitar and several other instruments. 2019 I had the amazing opportunities to 
  travel to Kenya in Africa and Nepal in Asia. During the same time I also got into recording 
  music at home. 2021-2024 I worked as a bicycle mechanic and had the opportunity to work couple 
  of months in Stockholm, Sweden as well. During this time I enjoyed listening long lecture series 
  of actual university studies about such topics as history of western music, history of film, 
  ethnomusicology and even psychology. October 2024 I started my studies. At the same time I took 
  an open university course at Sibelius Academy about Film Narration and Film Music History (5cr) 
  and kicked a long time habit of smoking. </p>

  <h3>OCTOBER 2024</h3>
<p>I started my secondary vocational, Audiovidual studies at Keuda, Järvenpää. </p>

<h3>FIRST YEAR OF STUDIES</h3>
<p>During the first 6 months we learned many things about cameras, 
  shooting videos and taking still-photos, working in a greenscreen studio and photography studio, 
  how to shoot interviews and take portraits, basics of graphic design and animated motion graphics 
  and how to design an audiovisual product from pre- to post production using professional equipment 
  and Adobe Creative Cloud. We were even taught how to create a website using website creation 
  platform, which I took further and created this website using html and css coding languages. 
  During those six months I also taught myself the basics of 3D-modeling.

  <h3>FIRST INTERNSHIP</h3>
<p>By being active I got myself an internship at a video studio. 
  The main point of this internship was to learn how to work at a professional multicamera 
  studio environment. I learned how to use TriCaster and how things work in a studio environment. 
  We practiced live-cutting to the point of being skilled enough to be employed. 
  I also got to do post production and learned critical skills about video editing and audio mixing. 
  I also gathered a 15 minute video edit of about 60 minutes of video footage, 
  for a short documentary. </p>
      

<h3>SUMMER 2025</h3>
<p>During the summer 2025 I did volunteer work at four different outdoor events of which two were 
  film festivals, one focused on Folk Music and one focused on outdoor activities. 
  I was 25 days at festivals in total and travelled approximately 3000km by bus. My work tasks were:
<br>
<br>  • Responsibility of sound and light of movie screenings at a circus tent of 500 people audience. 
  Basically operating a mixing console.
<br> • Working as part of the press/social media team.
<br> • Creating a video for youtube 
<br> • Photographing key moments (such as music concerts) of an event with a DSLR camera
<br> • Recording a concert using a wireless stereo microphone system
<br> • Recording video clips from a festival for the use of social media promotion. 
<br> • Shooting live video for an image magnification screen next to stage.
